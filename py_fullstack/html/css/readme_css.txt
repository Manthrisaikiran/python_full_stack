There are three methods of including CSS in an HTML document:

CSS can either be attached as a separate document or embedded in the HTML document itself.

Inline styles: Using the style attribute in the HTML start tag.

Embedded styles: Using the <style> element in the head section of a document.

External style sheets: Using the <link> element, pointing to an external CSS file.
